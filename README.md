# AR-masters-project
my project for masters degree at Charles University. augmented reality layer of ATMs in Prague for Layar platform.


The thesis deals with issues of visualization of spatial data using augmented reality technology.
The main goal of the thesis was to develop certain visualization rules and functions, based on proposed visualization parameters. The approach was based on developing of the augmented reality data layer of ATMs and then applying the developed functions of object selection, indexed data filtering and transformation functions for map symbols on the following layer. The work also deals with graphical solutions of the map symbols for augmented reality environment. The testing of the developed layer and the visualization rules system was held in the test sites on the territory of three municipal districts of Prague. Visualization outcomes from different test sites are evaluated in the thesis conclusion. The thesis proposes an approach for improving the quality of virtual elements visualization in augmented reality with the emphasis on overlap reducing, perspective perception and depth of virtual elements.
